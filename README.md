### Script to solve level 6 of a binary bomb

A binary bomb is a puzzle requiring knlowedge and understanding of assembly. You can read more about bianry bombs [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15213-s02/www/applications/labs/lab2/bomblab.html#:~:text=A%20binary%20bomb%20is%20a,proceeds%20to%20the%20next%20phase.) (note that to get a binary bomb you will have to follow your class' instructions).

Level 6 is the hardest part of the puzzle, so I've written a script to solve it for you.
Don't worry - This program is foolproof and you won't lose any points when using it!

### How to use:

1) Download the script and place it in the same folder as your bomb.
2) Enter the solutions for phases 1-5 as explained in the script (there are detailed instructions inside the file).
3) Enter ```gdb``` into the terminal and press enter.
4) Enter ```source solve_phase_6``` into the terminal and press enter.
5) There are 2 options to choose from:  
  a) Enter ```1``` in order to run the full script and get a solution.  
  b) Press any other key and the program will do a short demo run (so you can be sure the program isn't going to explode the bomb. If you choose this option, return to part 4 and run the program again, this time entering ```1``` for the full version.  
6) Let the script run until it finds the solution.
